- test static property with value (both constant and init function)

- verify that inner structs are getting created correctly:
  - inner class
  - class in a method
  - method in a method
  - lambda in a method
  - static property in a method
  - method in a property
  - property in a property
  - class in a property

- auto conversion
  - IntLiteral - > Int, ok
  - IntLiteral[] -> Int[] ???
  - Tuple(String, IntLiteral) -> Tuple(String, Int) ???

- tests
  - return 40 + 2
  - "void" was messing up test (so was "int" for gene)

- TypeInfo
  - nested / scoped stuff
  - methods
  - constructors

- Doc
  - type system - no terminals - why it's completely different
  - "free" objects, e.g. properties, array/tuple/function of this
  - arrays of structs - how a handle could indicate type of "Person" vs. "Person as an array element"
    (with any of them identifiable as: type="Person as an array element", array ref, index)
  - arrays of columns vs. rows (SIMD opts) -- could just be two different types
