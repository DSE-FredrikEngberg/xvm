- having two identical methods or properties produces a CompositeComponent for the corresponding Method/PropertyStructure

- conditional multi return method declaration fails to compile, e.g.: "conditional (Int, Int) foo()"

missing ">" causes an NPE
    class C<T>
        into M1<T | M2<T>

-- COMPILER-65: Could not find a matching constructor for type "Ecstasy:Exception". ("new Exception(s)")
