+ super() method call

+ Service
        - cleanup an un-referenced service (phantom refs?)
        +/- container terminates when all services are stopped

+ Function wrapping for services
+ Get/Set on the service

+ Matching the function/method return value with a Ref

+ FutureRef async completion handling

+ Atomics

+ Vars as "deferrable" registers

+ Arrays, Generic types

+ Refs to array elements

+ Refs to method arguments

+ DaemonPool scheduling - "native" stack implementation

+ Tuple, ConditionalTuple

+ Tuple construction - new TVAR, SVAR op-codes

+ Service reentrancy, timeouts and Fibers

- injection

- try-finally

- Property and Method

- Multi:
    +- new
    +- call
    +- invoke

- native Service methods

- Class, Type

- TypeSet and TypeComposition could be mutated by different threads
    (hence the use of ConcurrentHashMap in TypeSet and synchronization in TypeComposition)
