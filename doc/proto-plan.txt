+ super() method call

+ Service
        - cleanup an un-referenced service (phantom refs?)
        +/- container terminates when all services are stopped

+ Function wrapping for services
+ Get/Set on the service

+ Matching the function/method return value with a Ref

+ FutureRef async completion handling

+ Atomics

+ Vars as "deferrable" registers

+ Arrays, Generic types

+ Refs to array elements

+ Refs to method arguments

- Tuple, ConditionalTuple

- Property and Method

- Multi:
    -- new
    -- call
    -- invoke
    -- return

- native Service methods

- Class, Type

- TypeSet and TypeComposition could be mutated by different threads
    (hence the use of ConcurrentHashMap in TypeSet and synchronization in TypeComposition)
